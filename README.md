## Project: Advanced HTML and CSS

This project was developed as part of the bootcamp to enhance skills in **HTML5** and **CSS3**, exploring best practices and modern web development techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible structure, with classes following the BEM methodology to ensure code organization and scalability.
- **CSS3**: Application of the BEM methodology with a **flat** structure for styling, ensuring clean and easily maintainable code.

## Key Features Learned

During the development of this project, several advanced concepts were applied, including:

- **Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements** for advanced styling (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`, `[type]`).
- **Embedding iframes** and making them responsive.
- **Forms**:
  - Input fields with value restrictions (maximum and minimum).
  - Fields with different syntaxes, including labels.
  - **Checkboxes and radio buttons**.
  - Definition of **required fields**.
- **BEM Methodology**: Code organization to ensure scalability and easy maintenance with a **flat** structure.

## Challenges Faced

During development, several challenges arose, but important lessons were learned that will help improve future versions:

- **Styling checkboxes**: Customizing checkboxes proved challenging due to limitations in the default styles applied by browsers, but it was an opportunity to apply new approaches.
- **Implementing complex forms**: Creating forms with different input types and validations required special attention to ensure a smooth and functional user experience.

## Planned Improvements

- **Global styling**: Implement a global style using `:root` for standardization and easier code maintenance.
- **Customization of error controls** in forms, using pseudo-classes like `:invalid`, `:required`, and `input:invalid + .error-message` to apply specific styles based on the validation state of the fields.
- **Enhancing responsiveness**: Improve the user experience across different devices by utilizing `media queries` for a fully responsive interface.


## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to enhance skills in **HTML** and **CSS** by applying best development practices and modern trends. The project focuses on building a solid and scalable structure using the BEM methodology and exploring features like advanced forms and validations, as well as styling with pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
